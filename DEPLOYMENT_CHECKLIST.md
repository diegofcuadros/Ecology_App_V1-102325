- [ ] Added PostgreSQL database service
- [ ] Set environment variables:
  - [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
  - [ ] `PORT=3001`

- [ ] Backend URL saved: `_______________________________`

## Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

- [ ] Created new Vercel project from GitHub
- [ ] Set Root Directory to `/`
- [ ] Confirmed build settings (Vite detected)
- [ ] Set environment variable:
  - [ ] `VITE_API_URL=https://<your-railway-backend>.railway.app/api`
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] Frontend URL saved: `_______________________________`

## Post-Deployment Configuration

- [ ] Updated Railway `FRONTEND_URL` with Vercel URL
- [ ] Railway backend redeployed with new CORS settings
- [ ] Ran database seed to create demo accounts:
  - [ ] `railway run npm run prisma:seed --service backend`

## Testing

- [ ] Visited frontend URL - loads correctly
- [ ] Login page accessible
- [ ] Registration works (create test account)
- [ ] Demo accounts login:
  - [ ] Student: `student@test.com` / `password123`
  - [ ] Professor: `prof@test.com` / `password123`
- [ ] Professor can create assignments
- [ ] Student can view and start assignments
- [ ] Chat with AI tutor works
- [ ] Messages are saved and persist on refresh
- [ ] Professor can view student transcripts
- [ ] Professor can submit grades
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] No API errors in Network tab

## Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Custom domain for frontend (Vercel)
- [ ] Custom domain for backend (Railway)
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerts
- [ ] Configure email notifications
- [ ] Set up analytics

## Important URLs

**Production URLs:**
- Frontend: `https://_____________________________.vercel.app`
- Backend: `https://_____________________________.railway.app`
- Backend Health: `https://_____________________________.railway.app/health`

**Management Dashboards:**
- Railway: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Vercel: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Gemini API Console: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

## Demo Accounts

Created by database seed:

**Professor Account:**
- Email: `prof@test.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Student Account:**
- Email: `student@test.com`
- Password: `password123`

## Troubleshooting Resources

If issues occur, check:
1. Railway logs (backend service → Deployments)
2. Vercel logs (project → Deployments)
3. Browser console (F12 → Console)
4. Network tab (F12 → Network)
5. `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` troubleshooting section

## Security Reminders

- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Use strong JWT secrets (min 32 characters)
- ✅ CORS configured with specific frontend URL
- ✅ API keys stored in environment variables only
- ✅ HTTPS enabled on both services
- ✅ Database accessible only from Railway backend
